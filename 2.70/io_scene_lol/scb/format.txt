// League of Legends SCB file format
// It's the model format used for static (not animated) meshes
// It's converted from SCO files (SCene Objects) into SCB files (SCene Binary objects)
// It's pretty simple to figure out when you read through a SCO file and its corresponding SCB file at the same time!
// 
// This format description was written by DragonGeo2
// Please e-mail any corrections/suggestions/etc. to dragongeo2@gmail.com
// Oh, and lemme know if you use this format specification for anything, I'd be interested!

struct face
{
	unsigned3 indices; // the indices of the verts that this triangle uses
	char materialname[64];

	// These are prolly texcoords or RGB blends or vertex weights or something
	// The numbers (first, second, third, etc.) correspond to the order the floats
	// show up in the SCO file
	float firstfloat;// = .375
	float thirdfloat;// = .625
	float fifthfloat;// = .375
	float secondfloat;// = 0
	float fourthfloat;// = .25
	float sixthfloat;// = .25
};

// The SCB file starts here:
struct SCB
{
	char magic[8]; // always "r3d2Mesh"

	unsigned short majorVer; // always 2
	unsigned short minorVer; // always 2

	char object_name[128];

	unsigned nFaces;
	unsigend unk; // nSections? Always equals 1

	float3 center;
	float3 extents;
	float3 verts[nVerts];

	// Padding
	unsigned zeros_padding[6];
	char zero_padding; // what the heck!?
